### Heya, I'm Marc!

I'm a startup guy based in ☀️ Barcelona.

I love working around tech and innovation, and I thrive when I help founders with their startups.

[Here](https://github.com/marcalsius?tab=stars) you can find some cool projects I've been following lately.

How can I help you? At Codeworks (where I work) I wear many hats, but I can give you a hand if you are looking for developers. I'll be happy to leverage my network and connect you to potential co-founders! 

Happy to collaborate if you are on prototype/launch phase and you need help with product/marketing aspects. Or if you need any help with bureaucratic stuff! As I said, I wear many hats!

  I'm good at reading people

**Something you strongly believe?** 

  Innovation is not an individual phenomenon, but a collective incremental and messy network phenomenon.

**The last book you've read?**

  *How innovation works*, by Matt Radley. Nothing to do with my previous answer...

  How can I help you?
